## Design Philosophy

The color palette expands on Nyoom's unique aesthetic and is inspired by a contemporary and ever-changing IBM. Balancing mankind and machine, the colors are harmonious with nature, yet chosen for their luminous quality in the digital world. The oxocarbon color palette is a subset of the broader IBM palette.

The colorscheme is centered around a vibrant set of blues, combined with an industrial set of grays. The full palette extends from the blue family to the edges of the blue spectrumâ€”even the reds contain a hint of blue.

The resulting palette is a set of colors that portrays a singular IBM. Of the world and digital. Useful and judicious. Having multiple gray families gives each design the opportunity for nuance and meaningful moments of color. Each experience should be dominated by the grays and the core colors of black, white, and the blue family, allowing the other color families to have vibrancy and provide purpose.

With every port the goal is simple, give the user as much information about their application as possible while remaining easy on the eyes.

## Contributing

Before requesting or creating a port, please search through open [github issues](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon/issues) to see if your port has already been requested. If it hasn't, feel free to open an issue with what application you'd like a port and inforation about the application.

Before contributing, its recommended to read through the [style guide](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon/blob/main/docs/style-guide.md) for information on where and why to apply certain colors and general ideals to keep in mind while working on a port. You can then read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) to get started on your port.

Discussion primarily takes place on the Nyoom Engineering discord server
